# Search_file
Command line program that searchs a word in a txt file


When you execute the program by the command line you can give 2 arguments:
1)The path of the text file
2)wc // find

The wc argument counts the words in the file seperated by spaces.
The find argument asks a word from the user and finds the occurences of this word found within the file.

Every result of the program is logged in a separate .txt file which is automatically created if not found.
